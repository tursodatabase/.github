### What is Turso
  
Turso is an edge database, built by the creators of [libSQL](https://libsql.org), the Open Contribution fork of SQLite.

Turso allows you to develop locally and deploy globally to many locations around the world.
Replication is easy and affordable, and it is fully controllable through an API.

### Open Source

The Turso database is fully Open Source, and we [offer a managed service](https://turso.tech). However, the core code of the database doesn't live in this organization, but
in the [libSQL organization](https://github.com/libsql) instead. Relevant repositories:

### Code examples and experimental work

We keep code examples (including third-party contributed) and other experimental code that we haven't yet made the commitment to support in a separate organization.
Please find those at [turso-extended](https://github.com/turso-extended).
