- **Async Design** &mdash; Modern async primitives such as Linux `io_uring` to keep your apps responsive.
- **Concurrent Writes** (soon) &mdash; Multiple writers, zero conflicts, without locking.
- **Observability** (soon) &mdash; Out of the box with open telemetry integration.
- **SQLite Compatible** &mdash; Fully backwards compatible SQLite, but built for the next generation of agents.
- **Open Contribution** &mdash; Take your seat at the table and contribute to the next evolution of SQLite.
